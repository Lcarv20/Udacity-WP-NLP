# Udacity-WP-NLP

Udacity Project that allow users to use NLP on other sites and/or text.

For this project I have used the following tools:

1. webpack
1. express
1. sass
1. jest (testing)

### Setup

- To set up run `npm i` (to install all packages), and in case of vulnerabilities
  `npm audit fix` (sometimes it might need extra work).

If you want to run full dev mode, open 3 terminal tabs and on each run one of the following comamnds

1. `npm run-build-dev` (will run hot reload from webpack at port 8080)
1. `npm start` (will run your server code at port 8081)
1. `npm test`

or simply run `npm start` and open browser on localhost:8081
